I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's supposed to become a raytracer in the near future.

Instruction

1. pull from git with your IDE
2. build and open executable "Zaphod_master"
3. run "Zaphod_master"
4. follow the instructions given

note: 
- there is a default settig you can use
- if not:
   - colours to enter: red, blue, green
   - the camera has the position (0,0,0), there is a plane at x=-1
   - x-Coordinate: move sphere to left (first component negative) and right (first component positive)
   - y-Coordinate: move sphere up (second component negative!) and down (second component positive!)
   - z-Coordinate: move sphere back (third component negative) and forward (third component positive)
